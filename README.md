# Karaoke Subs That Teach Japanese
## The files
In the following Github Project are karaoke subs that are intended to teach you Japanese. There are subtitle files for two different anime episodes and one movie:

Card Captor Sakura Episode 1 (Cardcaptor Sakura Ep 1.ass)
Dr. Stone Episode 1 (Dr Stone Ep 1.ass)
Whisper of the Heart (Whisper Of The Heart.ass)

NOTE: For Dr. Stone, there are two different versions of the subs, one for Crunchyroll because it has a bumper that extends the length slightly (Dr Stone Ep 1 Crunchyroll.ass), and one for YouTube (Dr Stone Ep 1.ass).


## How to use
The easiest way to use them is with VLC player. In VLC player, you would start watching the episode or movie you intend to use the subtitles with, then right click on the screen and select Subtitle -> Add subtitle file, then pick the subtitle file you want to use. 

If you know what you're doing, feel free to use whatever player you want that supports subtitles with the ASS (Advanced Substation Alpha format)
