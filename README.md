# Karaoke Subs That Teach Japanese
In the following Github Project are karaoke subs that are intended to teach you Japanese.

## Disclaimer
I am not fluent in Japanese and mainly used a Japanese/English dictionary for these translations, so there may be some mistranslations. At best, I can give them an about 80% accuracy rating.

## The files
There are subtitle files for two different anime episodes and one movie:

- Card Captor Sakura Episode 1 (Cardcaptor Sakura Ep 1.ass)
- Dr. Stone Episode 1 (Dr Stone Ep 1.ass)
- Whisper of the Heart (Whisper Of The Heart.ass)

NOTE: For Dr. Stone, there are two different versions of the subs, one for Crunchyroll because it has a bumper that extends the length slightly (Dr Stone Ep 1 Crunchyroll.ass), and one for YouTube (Dr Stone Ep 1.ass).


## How to use
The easiest way to use them is with VLC player. In VLC player, you would start watching the episode or movie you intend to use the subtitles with, then right click on the screen and select Subtitle -> Add subtitle file, then pick the subtitle file you want to use. 

If you know what you're doing, feel free to use whatever player you want that supports subtitles with the ASS (Advanced Substation Alpha) format

Here is the completely legal link to episode one of Dr Stone as released by Toho Animation for promotional purposes. You can drag this video link into VLC player to add the subs to it:

## No FX
I have also put the Karaoke subs with just the timing and no special effects in the /RawKaraokeNoFX folder.

## Useful Tools
### seltran
sacred-serpent (https://github.com/sacred-serpent) is working on a Python app called seltran (Selective Japanese Translator) that will help to automate some of the process of translating subs from Japanese to English. Check it out if you're interested:
